The research project Chemistry with FUDGE is a cooperation between Furtwangen University and Leibniz University in Hanover. 
The aim of the project was to create a teaching and learning environment with the help of the university's own open-source engine FUDGE (Furtwangen University Didactic Game Editor).

The task was to present the orbital model of chemistry so that it can be better understood by students.
A representation for tutors was also required so that they could easily create and evaluate tasks.

The biggest challenge was to implement the rather complex theory in an engine that is itself still under development. Some things had to be implemented in the engine first so that they could be used in the application. 

A small insight can be found [here](https://hs-furtwangen.github.io/FUDGE-Chemistry_MasterW19/app/index.html).
