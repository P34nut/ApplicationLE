Grandpas Adventure is a WebGL prototype that was developed as part of the *Game Design* bachelor course. 
First, a concept was developed for an analogue game, which was then implemented as an analogue prototype. In a second step, this concept was implemented as a WebGL-capable prototype.

Grandpas Adventure is about your great-great-great grandfather, who was a great treasure hunter. However, he lost his life on one of his expeditions.
You now travel back in time to save your great-great-great-grandfather from death. 

The gameplay consists of several phases.
- In the first phase, the player explores the cave itself (in first-person) and can collect items and disarm traps.
- Afterwards, these items can be placed in a top-down view to guide the great-great grandfather. However, only in places that the player has seen.
- When the time is up, the great-great-great grandfather enters the cave and the player is only an observer.
