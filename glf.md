During my Bachelor's degree, I worked for two semesters at the university TV station GLF.

Here I gained insights into the production of reports and thus also expanded my knowledge of camera technology and post-production.
There were also live broadcasts, in which I was responsible for the feed in one semester and for the lighting design in the other.

Here are a few contributions that I made during this time

- Contribution on idea finding [here](GLFtv/Ideenfindung.mp4)
- Contribution on the DSGVO [here](GLFtv/DSGVO.mp4)
