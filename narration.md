The Narration in Games course was about developing a story-based game concept in groups as a basis for their own game design.

**Logline of the game idea  
Lost Unity will be a third-person adventure role-playing game, which will be released for the PC.  The game will, in our estimation, be played primarily by males between the ages of 16 and 40 who have an interest in long/exploratory role-playing games. The player is presented with an open world, which is actually divided into individual levels. The role-playing game specific aspects are mainly found in the game mechanics, but not in the character creation. We hope for a USK rating of 16 and PEGI 18. The photo-realistic graphic style contributes to a very immersive experience for the user. The goal of the game is, as the hero of the story, to rid the world of evil. What makes our game special is that it adapts to the player's choices in a way never seen before. The tube levels of the islands adapt to the previous choices and sequences of the game, offering a new gameplay experience in a unique game world with each playthrough.
