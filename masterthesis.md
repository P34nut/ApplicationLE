The following is my master's thesis entitled *Near real-time emotion recognition using machine learning techniques on high-frame-rate video data in the context of flow measurement*.


**Abstract:**  
In this master thesis, a neural network is used to predict an associated
emotion from very short and subtle facial expressions, the so-called micro
expressions. To achieve this goal, the neural network is trained using several
micro expression datasets and different parameter settings of the layers
and the input data. In the future, these predicted emotions will be further
processed to make it possible to measure immersion and flow states as part
of an experimental setup. This work is therefore an intermediate step on the
way to measuring flow. For those interested, it is to be observed how different
settings of the input data and parameters affect the result of the prediction.
