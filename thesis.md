The following is my bachelor's thesis entitled *Analysis of the components of a video game for the successful implementation of a good bond between the player and the main character*.

**Abstract:**  
The present bachelor thesis highlights the various components that are
important for a good connection to the main character and their influence on
the success of video games. The theoretical basics are explained and then
examined in an analysis based on three games. The insights gained in the
analysis are summarized in a conclusion and it is shown which components
are particularly important to develop a good bond with the figure and thus a
successful video game. This bachelor thesis is therefore interesting for those
who do not have much experience in video game development and want to
bring a successful game with interesting characters on the market.
