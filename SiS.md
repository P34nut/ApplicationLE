The game *Schritte im Schatten* is a unique transfer of the point'n click concept into a full motion video game. The player is transported back to the nineties and interactively experiences the adventures of private detective Ren√© Kamp.
Will he solve his latest case and thus escape his past? It's up to you.

The game was developed as a project during my bachelor's degree, which lasted two semesters.

In the first semester, we worked together as a team to develop a story and the associated screenplay. A lot of thought and planning had to go into it, because every scene had to be there. In contrast to conventional 2D or 3D graphics, it was not possible to simply add a scene or a different camera perspective later.

In the second semester, my task was to take over the sole programming. The Unity3D engine was used for this. 
I learned a lot about programming during this time and taught myself the C# language during this time, as we had only learned Java and Javascript up to this point. 

The project was a complete success, as the achievement was awarded the Media and IT Prize and the Audience Prize on Media Day in the winter semester 17/18.

More info about the project can be found on the [website of the game](https://schritte-im-schatten.de/). 

A demo can also be downloaded there.
Since then, some bugs have been removed from the game and English subtitles have been added so that the game can be published soon.

You can find a glimpse of the code [here](https://github.com/P34nut/Schritte-im-Schatten/).

It should be mentioned again that this was my first real Unity project and the code is accordingly messy and I would do many things differently today.
