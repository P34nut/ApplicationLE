The game A Cat in Time is a project that was realised during my Master's programme. In cooperation with the Medien- und Filmgesellschaft Baden-Württemberg (MFG), a mobile VR/AR-like game was to be created. MFG had brought several GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) on board for this, which provided open cultural data.

Our group decided on the city museum in Tübingen. Our task was to develop a mobile VR or AR-like game from the given cultural data.

The result was the game A Cat in Time, in which the player can walk through today's city museum and travel back in time at certain points to find out what life was like in the Kornmarkt/City Museum in the past.
In the past, small puzzles have to be solved in order to help the ghost cat reunite with its body at the end.
